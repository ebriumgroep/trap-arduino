# Erbium Trap: Arduino Code (Stable)
Welcome to the Erbium Groep / Group Arduino Code Team. 
This is the latest bleeding edge version of the trap firmware.

## Important
The terminal scetch is only used to test AT commands. The firmware under development can be found in the main folder.

## Branching
When working on a new feature, kindly create a new branch for that feature.
